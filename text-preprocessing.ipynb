    "**pandas is an open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python.

It's widely used in data science, data analysis, and data manipulation tasks.**"

    "## Here are some key components and concepts of the pandas library:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Series: A one-dimensional labeled array, similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a list in Python.\n",
    "  * DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can be of different types (numeric, string, boolean, etc.). It's similar to a table in a database or a spreadsheet.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Data Reading and Writing: pandas can read data from various file formats like CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more. It also supports writing data to these formats.\n",
    "  * Indexing and Selection: pandas provides flexible ways to index and select data, including label-based indexing, integer-based indexing, and boolean indexing.\n",
    "   * Data Cleaning and Transformation: pandas allows you to handle missing data, duplicate data, and perform operations like filtering, sorting, grouping, and reshaping.\n",
    "   * Aggregation and Statistics: You can easily compute summary statistics, apply functions to groups of data, and perform aggregations.\n",
    "  * Merging and Joining: pandas supports combining data from different sources through operations like merging and joining.\n",
    "   * Time Series Data: pandas has robust support for handling time series data, including date and time parsing, resampling, and time-based calculations.\n",
    "  * Visualization: While pandas itself doesn't provide advanced visualization capabilities, it can integrate well with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.\n",
    "3. Getting Started:\n",
    "To use pandas, you need to import the library. Common import conventions are:  \n",
    " **import pandas as pd**\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Basic Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Creating a DataFrame from data: df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "  * Reading data from a CSV file: df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "  * Displaying the first few rows: df.head()\n",
    "  * Indexing and selecting data: df['column_name'] or df.loc[row_label]\n",
    "  * Applying functions: df['column_name'].apply(func)\n",
    "  * Grouping data: df.groupby('group_column').agg(func)"

In English, tokens are typically words, but they can also be sentences, phrases, or even individual characters, depending on the context and task.**"

   "source": [
    "## Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Word Tokenization: In word tokenization, a text is divided into individual words. For example, the sentence \"I love programming\" would be tokenized into the tokens \"I,\" \"love,\" and \"programming.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Sentence Tokenization: In sentence tokenization, a text is divided into sentences. For example, the paragraph \"NLTK is great. It helps with NLP tasks.\" would be tokenized into the sentences \"NLTK is great.\" and \"It helps with NLP tasks.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Importance: Tokenization is a crucial preprocessing step in NLP. It provides the foundation for various tasks, including sentiment analysis, language modeling, machine translation, and more.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Whitespace and Punctuation: Tokenization is often based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks) and punctuation marks. Punctuation can be retained as separate tokens or combined with adjacent words, depending on the application.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.Ambiguities: Tokenization can be challenging for languages with complex word structures, such as agglutinative languages (e.g., Turkish) and languages with no clear word boundaries (e.g., Chinese).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.Subword Tokenization: Subword tokenization breaks down words into smaller subword units, which can be useful for handling rare or out-of-vocabulary words and for applying techniques like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**7.NLTK and Other Libraries: Libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, and the tokenize module in Python provide tools for tokenization. Different libraries might use different strategies and algorithms.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:\n",
    "Consider the sentence: \"NLTK is a library for natural language processing.\" Word tokenization would result in the following tokens: \"NLTK,\" \"is,\" \"a,\" \"library,\" \"for,\" \"natural,\" \"language,\" \"processing.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**And for sentence tokenization, the text \"NLTK is great. It helps with NLP tasks.\" would be tokenized into the sentences: \"NLTK is great.\" and \"It helps with NLP tasks.\"**"

    "\n",
    "6. Groups and Alternation: Parentheses () are used to create groups, which can be used for capturing or grouping subpatterns. The vertical bar | represents alternation, allowing you to match one of multiple alternatives.\n",

The idea behind stemming is to strip affixes (prefixes and suffixes) from words so that variations of a word can be treated as the same word.**"

    "1. Purpose: Stemming aims to simplify words to their basic form, which can help improve text analysis, information retrieval, and various NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: For example, the words \"running,\" \"runner,\" and \"runs\" would all be stemmed to \"run.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reduced Vocabulary: Stemming reduces the vocabulary size by considering different forms of the same word as a single word. This can help in tasks like text classification, where features are based on individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Algorithmic Approaches: Stemming algorithms use linguistic rules and heuristics to identify and remove prefixes and suffixes from words. Some common stemming algorithms include the Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer (also known as the Porter2 Stemmer).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Drawbacks: While stemming is a simple and effective way to normalize words, it can sometimes produce incorrect stems due to its heuristic nature. For example, \"better\" might be stemmed to \"better,\" while the correct root form is \"good.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Usage: Stemming is often used when the specific linguistic meaning of words is less important than capturing their basic form. It's commonly used in search engines, information retrieval systems, and text preprocessing pipelines."
